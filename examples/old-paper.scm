;; Copy this script to your ~/.gimp-2.6/scripts directory as old-paper.scm
;; restart gimp or click Filters->Script-Fu->Refresh Scripts
;; load/create an image
;; click Filters->Decor->Old Paper... to start the script
;; Add your own custom grunge touch-ups to the Blots layer (kinda hard to automate this
;;   as the script doesn't know what grungy looks would look good on your image) Duplicate
;;   Blots layer to make it look darker
;; Play with different layer modes on your image to find what looks good, Burn, Multiply,
;;   Overlay, Darken-Only and Grain-Merge modes typically are the ones that would look good
;; Make sure to Merge the layers before adding anything under the map layers or the map image
;;   will be overlayed ontop of those layers underneath as well around the distressed areas
;; Enjoy your brand new^H^H^H old paper/parchment look
;;
;; Feel free to let me know of any improvements/modifications you'd like and that you did
